<!-->
- 🔭 I am working in an ongoing project on decentraliced machine learning for mutlicentric clinical data analysis focussed on privacy preservation
- 🧠 I am currently self-studying the possibilities of containerization using different framework to intergrate the clinical data.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with federated learning architecture and integration of conternerization into it.
- 💬 Ask me about biostatistics, nutritional analysis and migration studies. (Trust me, I have a degree in Demography too!)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I like coding and learning new techiniques that which deals with medical statistics and clinical data.
